# Image Based Gem Stone Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository shows the project related to image based gem stone classification using ML algorithms and it cintains all files and documents used for this project for your further reference.

## Introduction 

Accurate gemstone classification is crucial to the gem and jewelry trade as the identification is an important in first step for evaluation and appraisal of any gem. Currently, the identity of a gemstone is determined using a combination of visual observation and spectro-chemical analysis. Gemmologists detect visual characteristics, such as color, transparency, luster, fractures, cleavages, inclusions, pleochroism, to facilitate the separation of gemstones. 

Identification of all gem characteristics is still difficult and time consuming, and not all laboratories have access to sophisticated instruments. In recent years, computers and algorithms have evolved significantly, and image processing and computer vision tasks are common place in many areas. In geological sciences, computer vision algorithms have been developed for classifying mineral grains, gems, soil and rocks.

This project represent  image  based classification of **2476** training and testing images and **340** images for prediction divided into **85** categories of gem stones.
